<h2>Air Travel Safety</h2>
The project for the semester involved a bit of role playing as data analyst/scientist working for an airline tasked with helping to combat a negative media campaign highlighting plane crashes and air safety concerns.  We produced five deliverables for this project:

- Products for internal audience:
  - Detailed analysis of data with visualizations
  - Executive Summary
- External products
  -  Infographic
  -  Blog post
  -  Presentation
